After your pictures are processed, you'll receive a username and password.  Your username will be <your last name><last two digits of the year>@joshthompson.photo and the password will be <your last name><6-digit date>.  Log into mega.nz with those credentials, or use their app, and you will be able to see a gallery of your photos in full resolution.  It is recommended you change at least the password.

 You can view your photos in Mega as a gallery.  You can also share individual files with your family and friends.  Or, create folders of photos you wish to share.  If you were to try to do this from the files on your device by email, you may run into file size limitations.   Rather than ever deleting your photos from Mega, you may wish to keep them there as a full-quality backup. 

From there you will be able to download all your files to your device.  When on your device, you could upload them to Google Photos in an album, Apple photos, or Amazon photos (which may not store them in full resolution).  Don't forget that you can make your album your screensaver on Chromecast/AppleTV/Firestick.  And if you keep them in several places, you'll be less likely to ever lose them!  You will also be able to upload them to a printery of your choice.  Contact me for recommendations.
