Each photo you see would be one of dozens taken at that moment. The photographer examines each one to select the best. Then he begins the painstaking and time-consuming process of editing each photo.  This is where the art comes in- adjusting all the coloring, removing blemishes, and just generally making the picture look better than real life. Each hour shooting means many more hours working on a computer to turn pictures into photos.

There is also all the initial outlay to buy high-end hardware (cameras, lenses, computers, memory cards, and backup solutions) as well as the software (Photoshop, storage services).  And there is the time invested to master the skills to use them.

So each hour you pay for represents just one of many spent before and after.  But if financial considerations are still a limitation, contact me and we can see what we might be able to accomplish together.
