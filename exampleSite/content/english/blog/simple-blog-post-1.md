I never thought I’d end up here!

Born and raised in Upstate New York, right inside the Adirondack Park, Josh spent most of his time outdoors. As a child, his summers were spent hiking, swimming, biking, and exploring the many wilderness trails surrounding his house. In his early teens he picked up a camera, and that was that. He found his new passion in photography, taking his camera with him on all of his many outdoor excursions. Josh quickly set his sights on becoming a landscape and wildlife photographer… That’s not exactly what happened though.

It didn’t take long for Josh to start getting inquiries about senior photos, and portraits. One thing led to another and he landed his first wedding gig. After that, he realized how much he would enjoy shooting weddings. Come on… who doesn’t love getting paid to party!? So once again Josh switched gears and decided to change his goals from selling prints, to becoming a wedding photographer. When he picked up his first camera he never imagined himself shooting weddings, engagements, or anything like that. But now weddings are by far his favorite thing to photograph!

Joshua is currently sitting at home drinking his coffee, and asking himself “Is it really necessary to write all of this in the third person?” In all seriousness though, it always makes me feel so good when someone chooses me of all people to take photos for them whether it's a wedding, engagement, anniversary, senior photos, or anything else. So thanks a lot for checking out my site, and I really hope you like what you see!
