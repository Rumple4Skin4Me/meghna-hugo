  - title: Own Your Photos
    icon: ti-world
    content: Industry-standard is for the photographer to own the rights to the photos
      he takes- meaning you only get high-quality prints at his price, his discretion,
      and in his own time and often with a watermark.  Your purchase comes with the
      right to own, print, and share YOUR photos at YOUR discretion.
  - title: Professionally Edited
    icon: ti-panel
    content: As you consider different photographers, look at the style and quality
      of the photos- do you really want odd coloring and lens flares distracting from
      your photos?
  - title: Digital Gallery
    icon: ti-stats-up
    content: Your original, high-quality photos will be available to you online where
      you can view, download, and store them as a backup.
  - title: Flexibility and Privacy
    icon: ti-announcement
    content: Share individual photos or groups of photos with family and friends-
      or keep them in a secure, private, encrypted vault.  The flexibility is there
      for you to do with your photos whatever you choose.
